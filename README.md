#titanic survival prediction
This project aims to predict the survival of passengers on the Titanic ship using machine learning algorithms. The dataset used in this project contains information about Titanic passengers, such as their age, gender, passenger class, and other relevant features.

To build the machine learning model, the following steps were taken:

The data was cleaned and preprocessed.
Different machine learning algorithms were evaluated, including logistic regression, random forest, and support vector machines.
The best performing algorithm was selected and used to train the final model.
The model was evaluated on a held-out test set to assess its performance.
The final model achieved a high accuracy on the test set, suggesting that it can be used to predict the survival of passengers on the Titanic with good accuracy.

This project can be used to learn about machine learning and how it can be used to solve real-world problems. It can also be used to explore the factors that influenced survival on the Titanic ship.
